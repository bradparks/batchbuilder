Batch Builder
============

BatchBuilder - Build multiple NME Projects using a SIMPLE GUI

A PRE PRE Alpha tool to build multiple NME projects using a GUI. This isn't ready for any serious use at all, yet....

Currently targets CPP builds, and has only been built using MonoDevelop on a mac.

It's so alpha that you need to edit code to specify the folder to search for NMML files to build ;-)

Edit src/Main.xh and change the following path to the path with your NMML files in it.

      var folder = "/Users/Brad/haxedemos/official_clean";
